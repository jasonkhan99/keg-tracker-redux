# _Keg Tracker_

#### _Track Kegs Bought and Pints Sold_

#### By _**Jason Khan**_

## Description

_This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs._

1.  As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store.
2.  As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
3.  As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
4.  As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
5.  As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
